# Sentimen-Analysis-with-feature-selection-Genetic-Algorithm
Genetic algorithm is one such optimization algorithm built based on the natural evolutionary process of our nature. The idea of Natural Selection and Genetic Inheritance is used here. Unlike other algorithms, it uses guided random search, i.e., 
finding the optimal solution by starting with a random initial cost function and then searching only in the space with the least cost (in the guided direction). 
The genetic algorithm is based on the genetic structure and behaviour of the chromosome of the population. The following things are the foundation of genetic algorithms.
1. Each chromosome indicates a possible solution. Thus the population is a collection of chromosomes.
2. A fitness function characterizes each individual in the population. Therefore, greater fitness better is the solution.
3. Out of the available individuals in the population, the best individuals are used to reproduce the next generation offsprings.
4. The offspring produced will have features of both the parents and is a result of mutation. A mutation is a small change in the gene structure.
